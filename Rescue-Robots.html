          <span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><b style="">Rescue Robots are designed to assist in the rescue of people after a natural disaster or someone when gets lost in the wilderness. In many situations it is too dangerous to look for survivors or there are large areas of difficult to search terrain. This is where robots can, and already do, assist in the rescue of people. In most current rescue robots, a human operator is required to find and control a drone, or robot. However, there are many reasons why it’s not practical to have a human operator. This is where AI becomes very useful and important for rescue robots to work effectively. To start with, AI is able to quickly identify objects, hazards and people given enough development.&nbsp;</b>
          <br>
          <br><b>A drone for example could fly a search pattern and use computer vision AI to spot any signs of survivors without any intervention or human error. People can be unreliable after long periods of staring at forest scanning for a survivor if they are plotting the drone. However, computer vision AI systems will work constantly at full effectiveness. So as long as the AI has developed enough, it has the potential to perform better than any human operator.</b>
          <br>
          <br><b>AI is vitally important to the function of rescue robots if the robot can’t be remotely operated. For example, a few years ago a Thai soccer team was trapped in a cave 1km underground. Any signal traveling to a rescue robot will be interfered with by the rock and will properly cut out or degrade. Instead of any robots, they had to send cave divers and 2 of them died. An AI system in some kind of well-equipped submarine robot could have theoretically made it to the soccer team to confirm the location. There are many advantages to having a rescue robot, for example, the robot could make a scan of the cave system for the rescue divers. The robot could have also carried supplies to the soccer team. The computer vision AI can use a variety of cameras and sensors to map the surroundings and navigate all on its own. At the same time, the AI can scan for evidence of the stranded soccer team using an infrared camera for example.&nbsp;</b>

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"><b>This application of computer vision AI for rescue robots is designed to help anyone because anyone could be in danger at some point for a number of reasons. However, its governments and certain private organizations who will deploy rescue robots. National park agencies for example sometimes already keep drones for quick deployment if a hiker is reported missing in the national park. Most of the current rescue drones aren't using computer vision AI because it's still a very new technology with not enough development to use in most real emergency situations. Cities which are prone to earthquakes like Los Angeles will properly in the future keep a fleet of rescue robots, like rescue drones and land robots that use legs to move around. In the event of an emergency, they could theoretically be automatically deployed to locate and assist people. People won't have to risk going into unstable buildings if a rescue robot can enter. Even if the robots are manually controlled, computer vision can still be used to assist navigation to control the robot eraser. For example stairs can be scanned to make moving up them easy for the operation, or automatic obstacle avoidance can be used. Surf lifesavers can also use drones to assist in rescues, or even hazard warnings. Drones have already been developed for this application.&nbsp;</b>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Computer vision AI needs a variety of sensors to create a virtual map of its surroundings and to identify obstacles, people and hazards to avoid. The CCD is the component of a camera that creates the digital image the AI can scan. However images are 2 dimensional and can’t give any kind of information about distance to an object which is why the computer vision AI needs a variety of distance sensors. LIDAR, Infrared Distance Sensors and Ultrasonic sensors are all common distance sensors. The reason why a rescue robot might be equipped with different types of distance sensors is because of the limitations of each. LIDAR for example damages the human eye because it uses lasers which is bad for a rescue mission. It is still useful in certain situations, and has a high accuracy and can track fast moving objects. An Ultrasonic sensor won't always work and has lower accuracy and Infrared distance sensors have a limited range. <br>
            <br>Other sensors can also be very useful for a rescue mission like an infrared camera. The infrared camera can the heat signatures of a person which can assist in recognition in low light situations. A touch sensor can provide a very reliable input if the AI fails to detect an object. <br>
            <br>These sensors are simply for the computer vision AI to be able to work. An actual robot will need motors and other actuators to move around, give supplies to survivors and manipulate obstacles in the way.

          <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Rescue robots will likely be run by two main AI systems, the computer vision AI which is the most important, and possibly a navigation AI system using the computer vision data to inform the navigation AI’s decision making. The computer vision AI uses a combination of the cameras and distance sensors to first gain an understanding of the physical environment, and warn everything is relative to the robot in space. The second part is the AI analysis of what the objects it sees are, for example detecting rocks, people, animals and the ground. The computer vision AI should be able to create maps and paths of the environment it navigated and more importantly where people who need rescuing are. <br>
            <br>The navigation AI would need to work with the computer vision AI to determine the best path to take to move from point A to point B. The navigation AI could also potentially take into account the stability of any object it wants to move onto based on visual data. If the robot is looking for someone in a collapsed building it needs to remember where it has already searched for efficiency. <br>
            <br>Depending on the use case, alterations to the computer vision AI or other AI systems need to be made. For example, if the robot is carrying supplies the computer vision AI might need to identify the people who need them and when it's close enough to drop them off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In a long rescue, mechanics might be needed for general maintenance like cleaning and testing the sensors.&nbsp;Software engineers, mechanical engineers and robotics teams are all going to be required personnel to develop this largely theoretical field of robotics. Rescue robots are a very new application of computer vision AI. Whilst software engineers have been doing lots of research into computer vision, the actual robots to control are still very new and largely limited to drones at the moment. However with further development into these new fields could lead to rescue robots being more prevalent.</b>

        </h2>
        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2"> In today's world, rescue robots are very new and as such are not commonly used. Even fewer have AI systems integrated into these robots or drones. However rescue drones with a human operator are very common for search and rescue missions allowing for quick coverage of large areas. <br>One example of computer vision AI being integrated is the Little Ripper drone by Westpac which has been implemented in certain beaches in Australia. The Little Ripper uses computer vision AI to detect Sharks and other marine animals in the water. As well as that it can be operated to drop an inflatable raft for a drowning swimmer. The drone has already been used to help rescue a swimmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">
          <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Rescue robots have the potential to improve society and public safety. With so many safety applications thousands of lives could be saved. Besides the applications for natural disaster rescue operations, beach safety can benefit massively from rescue robots. Whilst still in the early stages of development, drones have already proven useful in general beach safety. For instance sharks can be spotted earlier than normal. The current issue is the lack of implementation in normal life saver practices. <br>
            <br>One minor ethical issue is the few jobs that the rescue robots might steal. Whilst human crews will be needed for rescues for a long time, eventually the only rescue crew will be the people managing the robots, and the extraction teams. This small issue is balanced out with the fact that less people will need to risk their lives for rescue operations. <br>
            <br>The largest problem with the technology is the other ways it can be used. Drones with computer vision for example would be very useful for spy applications and data gathering. There will always be ways to twist technology into being useful for malicious purposes, but the positive implementation of rescue robots makes it worth it. <br>
            <br>During the development of the computer vision AI systems there is the possibility of the AI being trained in a way that produces racist results, when it comes to people recognition. If the AI isn’t trained with an equal mix of ethnicities, then it might not consider someone of a different race to not be a person.

        <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-2">
          <span style="font-weight: 700;"> The application of computer vision AI systems in rescue robots is a very promising field of robotics and AI. Already there are drones using computer vision to spot various objects, but hopefully in the future further development is put into the possibilities for this field. Rescue robots have a distinct advantage over human rescue teams, they can work for longer, they work at full efficiency all the time, they can enter hazardous situations without risking more lives and they can work in very large groups of other rescue robots. Computer vision AI systems should one day be able to pilot a rescue robot fully autonomously to avoid signal disruptions. Maybe one day rescue robots will be everywhere improving public safety. <br>
